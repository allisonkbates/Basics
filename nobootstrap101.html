		<p>I’m loving life in New York City. You’ll find me on the hunt for the perfect coffee, relaxing in Fort Tryon Park, and eating tacos.</p>

		<h1>Experience</h1>
		</div>
			<p>From marketer to product manager, I understand how to connect with users and build things that they care about. For a full view of my experience, take a look at my resume.	</p>
		<h2>Product Manager</h2>
		<p>Lorem ipsum lorem ipsum....</p>
		<h2>Data Nerd</h2>
		<p>Excel spreadsheets were just the introduction. Now I’m working with SQL and a tiny bit of ChartJS and D3 when I get the chance. But mostly, I just love looking at charts and sites like these: datasketch.es, the pudding, and fivethirtyeight.</p>
		<h2>UX Enthusiast</h2>
		<p>I’m building up my expertise in UX, creating wireframes and usability case studies for my new product ideas, which you can see here and here. I love working with a UX designer to let them do their magic and try to learn as much as I can from them on the way.</p>
